Webapp built with React and Vite

A simple dashboard to track newborns needs. Designed to run on an old phone to use on the changing table. Very basic and limited input, for tired parents.

babyboard in its actual state is intended for private use. If I find the time, it will be updated in the future, but for now I will test if its something we use for a longer time.
